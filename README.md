### The challenge

The link to a [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/5WXTnOu1Yy7vjCDCGKSnib/Getlinked?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=HjoXGqmatEgSVu5T-0) was provided and the challenge is to recreate the UI of the website with in the figma file.

Users should be able to:
  - View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
  - View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
  - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links
We use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy our project. It's easy and simple to use. It's also great for group works like this one as the live preview of each branch will be available so you can see what's going on before merging

Still in production but you can checkout the live-site [here.....](hackaton-1-0.vercel.app).

### Built with

  - Mobile-first workflow
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
  - JavaScript
### What I learned

I decided to take on this challenge with two of my friends. Why?
  - This is a perfect opportunity to learn more about git and github
  - Learning about git commands
  - Teamwork
  - Ability to read, understand and give corrections to each other's code
  - Being concious of the code you are writing as other teammembers might need to read your code later on

### Challenges

Most of the time we often get problems trying to fetch, merge, and we often encounter problems when trying to push to the main branch so we really took our time understanding it and how it works which slows things down but hey.....learning is what matters here

### Continued development

Any help with implimenting the API to the form section in the registration page and contact page would be very much appreciated. Check the link to the API [here...](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13489492/2s9YC5zYA5)
