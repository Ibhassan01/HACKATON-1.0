### Challenges

Most of the time we often get problems trying to fetch, merge, and we often encounter problems when trying to push to the main branch so we really took our time understanding it and how it works which slows things down but hey.....learning is what matters here

### Continued development

Any help with implimenting the API to the form section in the registration page and contact page would be very much appreciated. Check the link to the API [here...](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13489492/2s9YC5zYA5)
